Flags:
  --json                 Machine-readable JSON output
  --category <cat>       (bots) Filter the catalog to one category id
  --slug <slug>          (bots) Show a single bot's full port + param spec
  --input key=value      Repeatable workflow run input; values may contain "="
                         --input key=@path loads the value from a file (path is
                         resolved from the current directory); --input key=@@text
                         keeps a leading "@" as a literal character.
                         FILE fields (an Asset Input — "workflow describe" shows
                         them as source "asset") take a local file path instead:
                         --input hero=./photos/hero.png. The CLI uploads the file
                         and sends the stored asset in its place; a leading "@"
                         is accepted and ignored. An http(s) URL is accepted too
                         (--input hero=https://example.com/hero.png) — the server
                         fetches and registers it at launch. Pass an asset id
                         from an earlier upload to reuse it. Accepted files:
                         image PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF (≤15MB) · video MP4, MOV,
                         WebM (≤200MB) · audio MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG (≤50MB) ·
                         document PDF, TXT, MD, DOC, DOCX (≤25MB).
                         MULTI-CHOICE fields (describe tags them "multi-select")
                         take several picks in ONE value, comma-separated:
                         --input tone=casual,punchy.
  --fill <name>          (run) Launch from a saved fill — a named set of inputs
                         saved on THIS brand's copy of the workflow. Its values
                         become the run's inputs; any --input you also pass wins
                         for that one key, so a fill is a starting point, not a
                         lock. Names are exact (case-sensitive); an unknown one
                         is rejected before the run starts. Fills are created and
                         named in the dashboard's run dialog.
  --terminal <nodeId>    (run) Repeatable. Scope the run to the upstream closure
                         of these end node(s) — only nodes feeding a picked
                         terminal execute; the rest are recorded out-of-scope.
                         Omit to run the whole graph.
  --rig-overrides <json> (run, triggers fire) Change what an Image Rig box fires
                         for THIS ONE run, without editing the saved workflow —
                         a different number of images, a different meme format,
                         a different model. Takes a JSON object keyed by the
                         box's node id, or @path to a .json file holding one:
                           --rig-overrides '{"rig_1":{"lines":{"line_1":{"count":3}}}}'
                         Add "confirmLargeRun": true beside "lines" to allow a
                         run over the brand's image safety cap — the same
                         acknowledgement the tick-box in the app asks for. A box
                         or line name the workflow doesn't have is refused
                         before anything runs, and the error names it. On
                         "triggers fire" it REPLACES the schedule's own
                         overrides for that one test fire.
  --auto-approve         (run) Deliberately unattended launch: every Checkpoint
                         box this run stops at is approved automatically, with
                         whatever it was holding left exactly as it is, and the
                         run record marks each stop as auto-approved so you can
                         see nobody looked. Default is to park and wait for a
                         person's verdict. This is a choice you make for ONE
                         launch — it is never a setting on the workflow itself.
  --wait                 Poll until the workflow run reaches a terminal status.
                         (checkpoint retry) Re-runs the step feeding the
                         Checkpoint box and waits until its fresh output is
                         ready and the run parks again — that IS its finish
                         line; a redo never runs the workflow to completion.
  --id <runId>           Workflow run id for status detail
  --out <file>           Write the export to a file instead of stdout
  --out <dir>            (run --wait / status --id) Save every delivered output
                         of the finished run into this directory (created if
                         missing) and print the paths — text as .md, storyboards
                         and frame sets as .json, images/video/audio downloaded.
                         Unfulfilled slots are reported, never written.
  --version <n>          (export) Export a saved historical version instead of the
                         current head. <n> is the real 1-based version id from
                         "workflow versions" (a positive integer). A version
                         export intentionally carries NO triggers/description —
                         those aren't versioned, so a rollback leaves them
                         unchanged; head exports remain the only place triggers
                         appear.
  --json                 (export) Emit the legacy JSON contract body instead of
                         the default canonical YAML (escape hatch for tools that
                         still parse the old JSON export byte-for-byte)
  --update <workflowId>  (import/validate) Update this existing workflow in place
                         instead of creating a new one. Sends the contract's
                         updatedAt as an optimistic-concurrency guard — if it
                         409s, re-export the workflow, reapply edits, and retry.
  --dry-run              Preview import (validate + resolve refs) without writing.
                         Same server-side check as "workflow validate <file>" —
                         use validate as the standalone front door.
  --text "..."           (triggers fire) The input an EVENT trigger's run carries.
                         Required for event triggers; rejected for cron triggers.
                         (checkpoint edit) The replacement copy for one output.
  --file <path>          (checkpoint edit) Load the replacement copy from a file.
  --reason "..."         (checkpoint cancel) Optional reason recorded on the
                         cancel.
  --note "..."           (checkpoint retry) Optional correction for the redo
                         ("make the hook punchier"). Steps that call a model
                         follow it on the re-run; deterministic steps only
                         record it on the run's review trail.
  --reject <n[,n..]>     (checkpoint approve) Only for a Checkpoint box that is
                         reviewing a Splitter fan-out item by item. Drops those
                         ITEM numbers (the "Item N of M" headings in the show
                         listing, 1-based) and approves the rest. Rejecting is
                         filtering, not failing — the run carries on with the
                         survivors. Rejecting every item is refused: cancel
                         instead.
  --slot key=value       (answer) Repeatable. One answer per pending slot.
  --kind <kind>          (schema) Print just one node kind's ports + config rules
  --face <face>          (schema) Print just one transform face's spec

  # Roll a workflow back to an earlier version:
  exodus workflow export X --version 3 --out v3.yaml && exodus workflow import v3.yaml --update <id>

Notes:
  workflow describe prints the ENTRY CONTRACT — every input the workflow asks
  for, whether it's required or optional, the shape it accepts (a dropdown and
  its choices, a number, a true/false toggle; a plain text box shows no tag),
  and the author's help text. Supply those keys with --input; a value the
  contract can't accept is rejected before the run starts, naming the field.
  It also prints the EXIT contract under "Delivers" — the named results a
  finished run hands back, in the author's order: the slot's label, its key (the
  name --out files and a webhook key off), what kind of thing it is (text /
  structured data / file / set of files), and the author's note. A workflow with
  no Output node says so plainly ("Delivers: nothing — no Output node."), and
  "workflow run" repeats that as a warning before it spends the run. Against a
  backend too old to report deliveries the section is omitted entirely.
  "workflow run --fill <name>" launches from a saved fill instead of typing the
  inputs again — the fill's values fill the contract, and any --input you pass
  alongside it overrides just that key.
  Cold-start is a template, not a blank file: "workflow templates" lists the
  starters (incl. Winner Flywheel), "workflow templates export <key> --out f.yaml"
  writes the server-rendered YAML verbatim — edit it, then "workflow import f.yaml".
  "workflow schema" prints the LIVE graph vocabulary (node kinds, ports, config
  rules, transform faces, collector policy, wiring rules) from the backend you're
  deployed against, so what you author matches what will validate; --kind/--face
  narrow it, --json is the machine payload. "workflow validate <file>" checks a
  file against the live backend (it IS import --dry-run under its own door).
  "workflow run --rig-overrides" re-aims an Image Rig box for ONE run without
  touching the saved workflow: how many images a line fires, which meme format,
  which model. Node ids and line keys come from "workflow export" (or the box's
  panel in the app); anything you name that isn't there stops the launch and the
  message says which key was wrong. A trigger can carry the same payload in its
  YAML ("imageRigOverrides:" beside its schedule), so a Monday schedule and a
  Friday one can fire the same workflow at different sizes.
  workflow triggers are addressed by 1-based position — a trigger carries no id,
  so the CLI reads the live list from the export contract and sends a fingerprint
  of the trigger's fields as the guard; a concurrent edit fails loud rather than
  flipping the wrong trigger. Add or remove triggers by editing the YAML export.
  workflow export writes canonical YAML by default (human-diffable, key order
  fixed so equal workflows dump byte-identically); pass --json for the legacy
  JSON contract body. workflow import accepts either a YAML export or a legacy
  JSON file — same downstream, so YAML files work against the deployed API.
  workflow versions lists a workflow's saved history newest-first (up to 50);
  version numbers are real 1-based ids you pass to export --version. A version
  export intentionally carries NO triggers/description (they aren't versioned),
  so rolling back with import --update leaves them unchanged — head exports
  remain the only place triggers appear.
  workflow bots --json emits the FULL catalog response verbatim (--category /
  --slug filters are ignored in that mode). workflow bots --slug <slug> --json
  emits just that one bot's catalog JSON.
  workflow inbox lists every run parked waiting on you, badged by park kind
  (checkpoint/repair/slots/gate/legacy) and how it started (bg / trig:<event>).
  A run parked at a Checkpoint box is resolved with the "checkpoint" verbs: show
  what is waiting there, edit one output in place (edit 1 --text ...), approve
  (resume), retry (re-run the step feeding the box), or cancel. A Checkpoint is
  its own box on the canvas, sitting on a wire between two steps, so the diagram
  shows exactly where a run will stop. A require-all collector that stalled
  on a dead input is a "repair" park — retry it, skip the dead input, or kill the
  run. A nested sub-workflow waiting on inputs is a "slots" park — answer it with
  repeatable --slot key=value flags (run "answer" with no --slot to list the slot
  ids it wants). The "gate" verbs retired in 2.0 along with the Gate node — the
  command now prints a pointer at "checkpoint" and exits 1.

// A checkpoint park is a run that reached a Checkpoint box — its own node kind
// ("checkpoint", #1069), sitting on a wire between two steps and passing what
// arrives straight through once it is approved. The run parks with pauseReason
// "checkpoint" and waits — indefinitely — for the member to approve what is
// waiting there, hand-edit it first, re-run the step feeding the box, or cancel
// the run. (Graphs authored before #1069 carried a per-node switch instead;
// those auto-convert to a box, and frozen runs that parked on the old switch
// still resolve through these same verbs.)
//
// The one exception is a run launched with `--auto-approve` (#1079): that run
// was deliberately sent off unattended, so the server approves each Checkpoint
// the moment it is reached — artifact untouched, stop recorded as
// auto-approved — and the run never parks for these verbs at all.
//
// It is NOT a Gate node: there are no selection-port candidates and nothing to
// "pick". What the member reviews is the plain text held at the box, so the
// numbering below covers EVERY text artifact the parked node carries.

/**
 * One reviewable output held at the checkpoint, numbered 1-based for the
 * member, each carrying its index into the node's FULL outputs array — which is
