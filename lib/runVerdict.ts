// #1249 / #1261 — THE verdict word for a workflow run. Every CLI surface that
// renders one (the run detail, the recent-runs table, a verb's "that run isn't
// parked" refusal) calls this ONE function, so the CLI can never disagree with
// itself one screen apart the way #1261 caught it doing.
//
// Pure module: no Node imports, no HTTP, no I/O.

 * How many of a run's PROMISED delivery slots actually arrived (#1002's exit
 * contract, counted). This is the whole of what the verdict needs to know about
 * deliveries, and it is deliberately the smallest such fact:
 *   - the run DETAIL derives it from the full `deliveries` array getRun sends;
 *   - the run LIST reads it straight off `deliverySummary`, which the list
 *     query computes server-side (a list must never ship every run's artifacts).
 * Both reduce to this one shape before the verdict is decided, which is what
 * makes the two surfaces provably agree.

 *   - a repair/slots park read as a bare "Awaiting approval" (nothing was
 *     awaiting approval — the inbox already said `repair`), and a "call" park
 *     read as an approval at all (it is a parent busy on its child, #861);
 *   - a finished run whose work FAILED and whose exit contract went entirely
 *     unfulfilled read "Succeeded with warnings" — a member believed they got
 *     an ad when nothing was delivered. That run is Failed. The demotion needs
 *     the deliveries to be KNOWN and non-empty: an older backend that reports
 *     neither `deliveries` nor `deliverySummary` (or a workflow with no Output
 *     nodes) keeps the wire's own word.
