//
// HAND-SYNCED MIRROR of convex/lib/runStatus.ts — the CLI compiles standalone
// (tsconfig rootDir ".") and cannot import repo-root modules. The lockstep
// test convex/lib/__tests__/runStatusLockstep.test.ts fails CI on any drift —
// change BOTH files together. The CLI keeps the legacy aliases forever: a
// published CLI must work against old AND new backend vocabularies.
//
// Pure module: no Node imports.
